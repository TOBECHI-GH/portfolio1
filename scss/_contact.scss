// object-fit : cover is

// font : family/typeface (serif, monospace), weight (bold, light, medium), style (intalic, oblique) and size (px, %, em values)
// NOTE: An em is the equivalent to the width of a letter m.
// px is for precise control of text size. Default size of text in browsers is 16px
// percentage is w.r.t the default 16px. So 75% is 12px and 200px is 32px
// 1em = default 16px
// NOTE: Pixels are relative to the resolution of the screen, so the same type size will look larger when a scree has a resolution of 800*600 than it would when it is 1280*800

// font-family should end with a generic one
// If a font name is made up of more than one word, it should be put in double quotes.
